# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the devel branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ devel ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ devel ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "R-CMD-check"
  R-CMD-check:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        install.packages(c("remotes", "rcmdcheck"))
        remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
      shell: Rscript {0}
        
    # Check the package
    - name: Check the package
      run: rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = "--no-manual", error_on = "error")
      shell: Rscript {0}

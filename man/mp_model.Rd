\description{
Construct a multivariate probit model object that stores
information about model structure and parameters
}
\details{
The multivariate probit model has a multivariate binary
response variable, here denoted \eqn{Y}. The model is built from a
linear predictor
\deqn{M = X B}
where \eqn{X} is a n-by-J matrix of \eqn{J} predictors, and \eqn{B} is
a J-by-d matrix of regression coefficients.
Each row of \eqn{M} is the linear
predictor for one multivariate observation. The response variables \eqn{Y}
are linked to \eqn{M} by first defining latent Gaussian variables
\deqn{Z=M+E} where each row of \eqn{E} is a multivariate Normal vector,
\eqn{E \sim N(0,\Sigma)}. Then, \deqn{Y_{i,k}=I(Z_{i,k} > 0).}
Conditionally on \eqn{B}, each row of \eqn{Y} has a multinomial distribution
on the set of all \eqn{0/1} combinations, with each probability equal to a
hyperquadrant probability of a the multivariate Normal distribution
\eqn{N(\mu,\Sigma)}, where \eqn{\mu} is the corresponding row of \eqn{M}.

Only the inequality \eqn{Y_{i,k} > 0} for the response variables is used,
so alternative data representations such as \eqn{-1/+1} will also work as
expected.

The degrees of freedom for the normalised Wishart prior are linked to the
concentration pararameter \eqn{\eta} of the LKJ prior by the relation
\code{df = 2 * eta + d - 1}, which makes the two models equivalent.
